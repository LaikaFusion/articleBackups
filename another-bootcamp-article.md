## A rough feeling of learning to code

You’ve probably heard of coding bootcamps by now. If not from the numerous articles on Medium and other easy access writing platforms, then perhaps from the ads, or the Reddit posts, or the Twitter discussions. I was one of those people and I decided to take action. Over the last fraction of a year I’ve attended one of these bootcamps. I won’t state which one, as this is not intended to promote the one I attended which is of course the best one. Here’s what I got out of it.

First a brief history of me. I used to work in IT departments, mostly doing technical support but sometimes I would do other things. I rewrote a website, and I’ve churned out more process documentation then I care to remember. When headed into the bootcamp, I was on the upper end of of the bell curve for technical knowledge. Having both written websites for other projects and jobs though LAMP stack based ones. I could have taught myself most of the curriculum that was not purely computer science. However I still think I benefited here.

Self study tends to get you cozy with one thing, and it’s harder to want to jump to a new topic rather then master your current one. If you learn React, why would you jump to learning Django, or C? With set assignments you do not really have that choice. In life you will also likely not have that choice. Technologies come and go, especially in the world of web development where it feels like every few months a new thing that people want is introduced. I learned what I was good at and what gave me trouble during the bootcamp.

You also gain a good place to ask questions. Not just from the instructors, but also from students who have either just gone through what you’re doing or are currently going through it. This support network is great, knowing that your questions will be answered and you do not have to wait as long for public forums like StackOverflow, or the many Discord and Slack channels that exist. People in the Slack channel that the bootcamp runs loved to help people, and often you would find multiple responses for most questions within an hour.

The commitment is also beneficial. Having decided that 8 hours a day would be spent in class or coding, I found myself actually working those 8 hours everyday. If I finished early it was right on to the next project often times one of the side projects that taught me other skills that came in handy later.

I won’t claim everything was fantastic. That would be a lie, and I believe the bootcamp I attended knew that changes should be made. They regularly change the curriculum and other programs they provide. I still think I emerged a much better coder then I was at the start. My next big task is to find a job and prove myself right.
